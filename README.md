This project involves developing a mobile app for MOCHE to gamify the brand experience for the average teen.

In this app, we try to implement the most common gamification strategy: a points system and classification with a national leaderboard. The flow of this app is very practical and intuitive: the user completes some tasks, presented as "Challenges", and, doing so, earns some rewards. These rewards can be points, digital badges, exclusive wallpapers, or small amounts of mobile data, depending on the type of mission. After that, using the points that the user has already earned, he can buy some MOCHE products or, simply, play a game. This game, a "memory game" type of game, consists of a point multiplier or an awards giver: the player can win event tickets, coupons for discounts on the collaborative companies with MOCHE, or MOCHE discounts.

This way, the teenager is stimulated to know the MOCHE brand identity and its policies, also, this app reinforces the bond between the last generation and MOCHE.Technologies in use: React-Native with TypeScript and JavaScript.
